The foyer of the building stretches out in a large oval with the narrow ends on the left and right. 
A semi-circler, tall <reception desk> is prominently placed against the back wall of the room with a 
large double <glass door> to its left which leads further into the building. 
On the left side of the room there is another door with the name plate on it saying, <Security Office>. 
As you look to the right of the room, you see a <2 - lift> door and a <2 - waiting area> which is 
nestled to back up against the glass front windows.

As you approach the Reception desk you see a brown haired <receptionist> wearing intelligent 
looking yet elegant round frame glasses. She appears to be engrossed in her work and doesn’t notice 
you immediately. You take the opportunity to glance over the top edge of the desk, down at the 
items on the desk top. There seems to be a number of <post-it notes> scattered around, normally 
just out of view. A <phone> sits on the far side of the desk, where a second receptionist would more 
easily be able to answer it and a <notepad>, with something written on it is placed within easy 
reaching distance of the receptionist.

The waiting area consists of three tan leather sofas set in a U shape, with the open end facing the main entrance.

There are a few magazines laid out on a short coffee table in the middle of the U shape to help pass the <wait> .
