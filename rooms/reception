The foyer of the building stretches out in a large oval with the narrow ends on the left and right. 
A semi-circler, tall <reception desk> is prominently placed against the back wall of the room with a 
large double <glass door> to its left which leads further into the building. 
On the left side of the room there is another door with the name plate on it saying, <Security Office>. 
As you look to the right of the room, you see a <2 - lift> door and a <2 - waiting area> which is 
nestled to back up against the glass front windows.

As you approach the Reception desk you see a brown haired <receptionist> wearing intelligent 
looking yet elegant round frame glasses. She appears to be engrossed in her work and doesn't notice 
you immediately. You take the opportunity to glance over the top edge of the desk, down at the 
items on the desk top. There seems to be a number of <post-it notes> scattered around, normally 
just out of view. A <phone> sits on the far side of the desk, where a second receptionist would more 
easily be able to answer it and a <notepad>, with something written on it is placed within easy 
reaching distance of the receptionist.

RD - Notepad
Reading the notepad upside down and slightly sideways, you see the words written: “Guest Pass for  new salesman Mr Preston – Expected @14:45”. This gives you an idea! You could call reception and pretend to be ‘Mr Preston’. Now all you have to do is find another phone!

R1 - Glass door (GD)

You approach the glass door and see next to it on the wall a small electronic pad.
It looks like a <card reader>. You can see the hallway beyond with a few doors leading off to either side.

** Check inventory method needed
*if have no card*
You have no card to scan. 
(Auto Go Back)
*If have card*
You scan the ID Card and the card reader makes a short affirmative *boop*.
With that the two glass panels glide apart and you pass through.

The waiting area consists of three tan leather sofas set in a U shape, with the open end facing the main entrance. This gives each sofa a varying view, from the reception to the those entering through the main door and the final facing out the window to the carpark area outside. There are a few magazines laid out on a short coffee table in the middle of the U shape to help pass the <wait> .
