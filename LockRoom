Locker Room (LR)
The room is narrow and bordering three walls are a collection of storage lockers. 
Ten full size lockers are against the right-hand wall with a matching Ten opposite 
them against the left-hand wall. The wall towards the back of the room is roughly 
half the size of the other two walls and therefore has two rows of five half-sized 
lockers which had been stacked to give in total an additional Ten lockers. 
Each locker is sequentially numbered.


lockers 1-13 & - open/empty
You open locker <number> and find that it is empty.

lockers 14-17 & 24-30 – locked
You go to open locker <number> but it appears to be locked.

Locker 18-23 – open + progression once
As you open locker <number> you hear someone else enter the room. You pretend to be retrieving 
something from your non-existent bag in the empty locker. The person passes behind you and goes 
further down your row. Out of the corner of your eye you see them take their pass from around 
their neck and put it inside the locker. They then take out a lunch box and locking their locker behind 
them. As they exit the room they slip their locker key into the pocket of their worn work coat.
