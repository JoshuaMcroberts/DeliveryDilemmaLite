Locker Room (LR)
The room is narrow and bordering three walls are a collection of storage lockers. 
Ten full size lockers are against the right hand wall with a matching Ten opposite 
them against the left hand wall. The wall towards the back of the room is roughly 
half the size of the other two walls and therefore had two rows of five half-sized 
lockers which had been stacked to give in total an additional Ten lockers. 
Each locker is sequentially numbered.


lockers 1-13 & 18-20 - open/empty
lockers 14-17 - locked
lockers 22-30 - locked + progression 
locker 21 - Unlockable
