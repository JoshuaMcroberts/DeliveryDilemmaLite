It was the night before the delivery deadline before Christmas... 
and all throught the house soft clicking could be hard coming from a computer mouse.
Packages had been wrapped and stacked up with care, 
In hopes that in the morning Amazon Prime Delivery would be there.

With the wreeing of printer and 
# printing and labeling

So <character name> went off to there bed, 
with dreams of their thankful friends playing in their head.
<character name> was fast asleep all night long,
Til the next morning when they awoke with a *Ding dong*

A rap on the door? Ah the Courier is here! 
"Hold on just a second, I'll be right there!"
With the hussle and bussle of percals to van,
the courier smiled, he was a jolly ol' man.

"I say my dear chap, I don't mean to alarm, 
but this package has no label" he pointed to one under his arm.
<character name> : "It must be round here somewhere I printed them all out lastnight,
I'll have a look inside you just sit tight!"

# Quicky grabs and slaps on a label

# Realises mistake......
