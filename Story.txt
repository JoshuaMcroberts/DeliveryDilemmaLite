It was the night before the delivery deadline before Christmas... 
and all through the house was heard the soft clicking and whirring of printer and mouse.
Parcels lay strewn in every which way with wrapping and packaging all on display.

The rush was on for the deadline you see and <Character Name> had left the parcel packing until after his tea.
Each box for a friend would be stacked my the stair,
In hopes that in the morning Amazon Prime Delivery would be there.

In the midst of the doorbell did ring, 
“Who could that be?” <character name thought> say they tied up a string.
It was a late night delivery off something unknown,
Maybe a book or a beagle or an old style gramophone?
 
With the parcel signed for a courier on his way,
<character name> went back to their busy wrapping day.
With their new delivery almost opened there was another strange thing,
From the living room a mobile phone did sing. 

A call from an Auntie that put time off track, 
Left our protagonist picking up the slack.
With last labels printed and hurriedly stuck on,
It was time to go to bed and dream through until dawn.

Wrenched from a dream as as the good bit drew near,
By a rap on a door? Ah the Courier is here! 
A swift hustle and bustle of parcels to van,
and a thank you mince pie of the delivery man.

Now time to relax a good job had been done. 
Every last parcel away! But wait, what’s this one?
With shock and surprise after the slightest delay, 
remember was the unopened gift from yesterday.

So <character name> went off to there bed, 
with dreams of their thankful friends playing in their head.
<character name> was fast asleep all night long,
Til the next morning when they awoke with a *Ding dong*

A rap on the door? Ah the Courier is here! 
"Hold on just a second, I'll be right there!"
With the hussle and bussle of percals to van,
the courier smiled, he was a jolly ol' man.

"I say my dear chap, I don't mean to alarm, 
but this package has no label" he pointed to one under his arm.
<character name> : "It must be round here somewhere I printed them all out lastnight,
I'll have a look inside you just sit tight!"

# Quicky grabs and slaps on a label

# Realises mistake......
