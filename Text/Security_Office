An imposing array of monitors looms large over you on the right wall of the room as you enter. 
Bathing everything in a pale blue light. Lazily seated at a <desk> below the wall of screens is a 
lone <security Guard> snacking on a chocolate bar and looking at his phone. Directly opposite 
the door a <coat rack> bears few garments and along the back wall stands a bank of three <lockers>.

A closer look at the desk reveals a scattering of chocolate bar wrappers and empty drinks cans. 
There is a desk mounted <monitor> that sit in front of a keyboard. It seems to have been recently 
used. A <bin> sits just to the right of the desk and is completely empty.  A <phone> sits in the 
centre of the desk on the left of the monitor and keyboard.

<character> looks at the monitor and sees a Word Document is opened with the title of 'How Can Planes Fly Upside Down?'. 
There doesn't seem to have been much progress made. A couple of tabs in the browser show some signs of the pursuit of 
the thesis however the user seems to have been distracted by cat videos on YouTube. There is <sticky note> stuck to the 
side of the monitor.
