The foyer of the building stretches out in a large oval with the narrow ends on the left and right. 
A semi-circler, tall <reception desk> is prominently placed against the back wall of the room with a 
large double <glass door> to its left which leads further into the building. 
On the left side of the room there is another door with the name plate on it saying, <Security Office>. 
As you look to the right of the room, you see a <2 - lift> door and a <2 - waiting area> which is 
nestled to back up against the glass front windows.

As you approach the Reception desk you see a brown haired <receptionist> wearing intelligent 
looking yet elegant round frame glasses. She appears to be engrossed in her work and doesn't notice 
you immediately. You take the opportunity to glance over the top edge of the desk, down at the 
items on the desk top. There seems to be a number of <post-it notes> scattered around, normally 
just out of view. A <phone> sits on the far side of the desk, where a second receptionist would more 
easily be able to answer it and a <notepad>, with something written on it is placed within easy 
reaching distance of the receptionist.

*if called and appointment not changed
<character>: Hello, can you help me please? I believe we spoke on the phone earlier.
(The Receptionist has a slightly puzzled look on his face)
<character>: My name is Preston, Mr/Miss Preston. 
Receptionist: Oh yes! Forgive me there is a lot on with the Christmas Rush. You appear to be a good bit earlier than expected…
<character>: Ah Yes, unfortunately my previous meeting was cancelled. I was hoping Mr Barber would be free a little earlier.
Receptionist: I’m sorry but Mr Barber won’t be in until 14:30 so you will have to wait for him. 
<character>: Oh ok, would I be able to wait in his office?
Receptionist: I’m sure that would be fine, his PA should be there already. Here is a Guest Pass, I hope you don’t have to wait too long. 
 <character>: I’m sure it’ll find some way to pass the time. Thank you again Anna.

Recep convo tree
The receptionist is lost in her work and doesn’t seem to notice you standing at the desk. You start a conversation with her:
*if no phone call
The receptionist looks very busy you should probably not disturb her without a good reason. 
*if change time
Ch: Hello there, I’m Mrs/Miss Preston…
Recp: Ah yes, Hello Mr/Miss Preston. I’m afraid to tell you that Mr Barber will be in at 14:30 and is unreachable until then. You can wait for him in his office, his PA should be there.
Ch: Oh that’s a shame, but yes I’ll do that.
Recp: OK, here is your Guest Pass, make sure to return that to me when you are leaving. 
Ch: Will do
Recp: Do you know where the Mr Barbers office is?
Ch: I’m sure I’ll manage to find my way
Recp: OK, see you later then.
*if no change time
Ch: Hello there Anna, I do believe we spoken on the phone earlier.
The receptionist looks up slightly confused…
Ch: I’m Mr/Miss Preston. We spoke on the phone?
Recp: Oh Yes sorry, everything is crazy with the Christmas rush, our last deliveries are due to go out next week. Are you not a bit earlier than your appointment?
Ch: Ah yes, unfortunately my pervious engagement was cancelled so I thought I might come down here early to see if Mr Barber was available now.
Recp: I’m sorry to have to tell you this but Mr Barber won’t be in the office until 14:30 at the earliest.
Ch: In that case, is it alright if I wait for him in his office?
Recp: That shouldn’t be a problem. His PA should be there. 
CH: That’s great, Thank you.
Recp: Ok, here is your Guest ID Card. Make sure to leave that in with me on your way out.
Ch: OK I’ll try not to forget.
Recp: I hope you don’t get too bored waiting.
Ch: I’m sure I’ll find some way of passing the time.



RD - Phone

RD - Post-it notes

 
RD - Notepad
Reading the notepad upside down and slightly sideways, you see the words written: “Guest Pass for  new 
salesman Mr Preston – Expected @14:45”. This gives you an idea! You could call reception and pretend to 
be ‘Mr Preston’. Now all you have to do is find another phone!

The waiting area consists of three tan leather sofas set in a U shape, with the open end facing the main entrance. This gives each sofa a varying view, from the reception to the those entering through the main door and the final facing out the window to the carpark area outside. There are a few magazines laid out on a short coffee table in the middle of the U shape to help pass the <wait> .
