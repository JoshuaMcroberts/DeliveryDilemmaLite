Canteen
The Canteen is a small room with a <bench> that starts against the right-hand wall and wraps around 
the edge of the room to the back wall. A <fridge> stands up-right against the back wall, pushed into 
the left corner of the room. A <coat rack> seems to have been haphazardly attached to the wall on 
the left of the door as you enter the room. Two workers sit in the at one of the two tables in the 
room staring at their phones. 

Coat Rack (Canteen)
A brief glace at the coat rack informs you that there are two items of clothing hanging there. The 
first of which being an old tattered high-vis vest and the second of which being a work <coat>.

Coat
The coat looks like it has been in use for some time. It has high-vis strips strategically sown onto it. It 
seems to be a straight-forward design with a <left pocket> and <right pocket> the only two places 
you can see where anything could be stored.

Right Pocket 
You put your hand quickly into the right pocket and bring it out to find it contains only a sticky old 
boiled sweet and some pocket lint which has now become stuck to your fingers.

Left Pocket
When you simple your hand into the left pocket of the coat it immediately comes into contact with 
something cold and metallic. You withdraw your hand to find clutched in it a locker key with the 
number 21 written on a tag attached to it.
